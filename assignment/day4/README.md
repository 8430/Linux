Hi ninja's, This is your fourth assignment and we expect you guys to complete it on time Make sure that you make a doc of it so that we can evaluate your progress.

     - Note: Don't install php directly using yum or apt-get,compile it from source using PREFIX with /usr/local/php directory
     - You may try to do it manually first and then note down the steps to automate later using shell script
